# GiUCAN Firmware

This repository contains sources for GiUCAN, a minimalistic version of [BACCAble](https://github.com/gaucho1978/BACCAble) for Diesel engines with 7 inches dashboard; it's interacting with C1 nad BH bus only and providing this subset of functionalities:

- Smart Start and Stop disabling ✔
- DPF regeneration warnings ✔
- Dashboard info display ✔

It's tested and documented using [FYSETC UCAN](https://github.com/FYSETC/UCAN) **ONLY**; as it's derived from [Canable-fw](https://github.com/normaldotcom/canable-fw) it should work with 

## DISCLAIMER

GiUCAN is an experimental project developed solely for educational and research purposes. It is strictly prohibited to use this tool on vehicles operating on public roads or in any manner that may pose a risk to public safety, violate laws or regulations, or cause harm to people or property.

The developer of GiUCAN assumes no liability for any damages, malfunctions, legal issues, or other consequences arising from its use. All responsibility lies with the end user, who assumes full civil, criminal, and legal liability for any misuse.

Do not use this project in real-world vehicle control or autonomous driving applications.

## Rationale

I'm contributing to the [BACCAble](https://github.com/gaucho1978/BACCAble) repository, I'm keeping this one strictly target to my needs; the goal is to use it as a learning playgroud.
Please check the amazing [BACCAble](https://github.com/gaucho1978/BACCAble) project!

## Supported Commands in CANable mode

- `O` - Open channel 
- `C` - Close channel 
- `S0` - Set bitrate to 10k
- `S1` - Set bitrate to 20k
- `S2` - Set bitrate to 50k
- `S3` - Set bitrate to 100k
- `S4` - Set bitrate to 125k
- `S5` - Set bitrate to 250k
- `S6` - Set bitrate to 500k
- `S7` - Set bitrate to 750k
- `S8` - Set bitrate to 1M
- `M0` - Set mode to normal mode (default)
- `M1` - Set mode to silent mode
- `A0` - Disable automatic retransmission 
- `A1` - Enable automatic retransmission (default)
- `TIIIIIIIILDD...` - Transmit data frame (Extended ID) [ID, length, data]
- `tIIILDD...` - Transmit data frame (Standard ID) [ID, length, data]
- `RIIIIIIIIL` - Transmit remote frame (Extended ID) [ID, length]
- `rIIIL` - Transmit remote frame (Standard ID) [ID, length]
- `V` - Returns firmware version and remote path as a string

Note: Channel configuration commands must be sent before opening the channel. The channel must be opened before transmitting frames.

This firmware currently does not provide any ACK/NACK feedback for serial commands.

## Building, Flashing  and Debugging

Please read [Canable-fw README.md](https://github.com/normaldotcom/canable-fw/blob/master/README.md) as make will build SLCAN firmware by default.

Plaese read [GiUCAN GitHub Pages](https://anegrin.github.io/GiUCAN/) to learn about:

- Hardware and connections
- Building for SLCAN, C1CAN and BHCAN
- Flashing using [STM32CubeProgrammer](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeprog.html)
- Customizing build for small displays, gasoline etc.
